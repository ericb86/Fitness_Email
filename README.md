# Daily Fitness Email Automation

This Python script emails you a daily combination of:

- A random **breakfast**, **lunch**, and **dinner** from your meal plan
- A workout tailored to the day of the week, blending gym and home recovery routines

The goal: make health and fitness effortless by removing decision fatigue — just open your inbox and follow the plan.
